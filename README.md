## Group Chat Admin Logic

### How Group Admins Work
- **The user who creates a group is automatically assigned the role of 'admin'.**
- **All other users added to the group are assigned the role of 'member'.**
- **Only admins can add/remove members or promote/demote other members to admin.**
- **This is enforced both in the UI and in the backend logic.**

### How It Works in Code
When a group is created, the following logic is used to add members:

```ts
// Add members (current user as admin + selected users as members)
const members = [
  { chat_id: chatData.id, user_id: currentUserId!, role: 'admin' },
  ...selectedUserIds.map((id) => ({ chat_id: chatData.id, user_id: id, role: 'member' }))
];
await supabase.from('chat_members').insert(members);
```
- The group creator (`currentUserId`) is always added as an admin.
- All other selected users are added as members.

### Member Management
- In the group member management UI, only users with the 'admin' role can:
  - Add new members
  - Remove members
  - Change the role of other members (promote/demote)
- Regular members cannot manage other members or roles.

### Why This Matters
- This ensures that every group always has at least one admin (the creator by default).
- Only trusted users (admins) can manage the group membership and roles.

### Customization
- You can further restrict role changes (e.g., prevent the last admin from demoting themselves) by adding additional checks in the member management logic.

## üìé File and Image Uploads

### How Attachments Work
- **Users can upload and send images, videos, documents, and audio files in any chat.**
- **Supported file types:**
  - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  - Videos: MP4, WebM, OGG
  - Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX
  - Audio: MP3, WAV, OGG
- **File size limit:** 10MB per file
- **Where files are stored:** All attachments are uploaded to [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage).

### How to Use
- Click the üìé (paperclip) or üì∑ (camera) icon in the message input area to select a file or image.
- The file is uploaded to Supabase Storage and a message with the attachment is sent to the chat.
- **Images** are displayed as previews in the chat. Click to view full size.
- **Other files** (PDFs, docs, etc.) are shown as clickable links with an icon and filename.

### Example Code (Upload Logic)
```ts
// Utility function for uploading a file to Supabase Storage
export async function uploadFile(file: File, chatId: string): Promise<UploadedFile | null> {
  // ...validation and type checks...
  const filePath = `chats/${chatId}/${file.name}`;
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from('attachments')
    .upload(filePath, file, { cacheControl: '3600', upsert: false });
  if (error) throw error;
  // Get public URL
  const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
    .from('attachments')
    .getPublicUrl(filePath);
  return { url: publicUrl, type: fileType, name: file.name };
}
```

### How It Looks in Chat
- Images appear as thumbnails/previews.
- Other files show as links with an icon and filename.
- All users in the chat can download/view attachments.

### Security
- Only authenticated users can upload files.
- Anyone with the link can view/download files (public bucket).
- File type and size are validated before upload.
